Using temporary credentials with Amazon Connect You can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken. Amazon Connect supports using temporary credentials.

Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles. Amazon Connect supports service-linked roles. For details about creating or managing Amazon Connect service-linked roles, see Use service-linked roles for Amazon Connect.

       "    'Value': {'StringValue': 'How Amazon Connect works with IAM\\nPDF\\nRSS\\nBefore you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Connect, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Connect. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Connect and other AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.\\nTopics\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nWith IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Connect supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.\\nActions\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don\\'t have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.\\nInclude actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.\\nPolicy actions in Amazon Connect use the following prefix before the action: connect:. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Connect defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.\\nTo specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:\\n\"Action\": [\\n      \"connect:action1\",\\n      \"connect:action2\"\\nYou can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:\\n\"Action\": \"connect:Describe*\"\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect actions, Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nResources\\nAmazon Connect supports resource-level permissions (specifying a resource ARN in an IAM policy). Following is a list of Amazon Connect resources:\\nInstance\\nContact\\nUser\\nRouting profile\\nSecurity profile\\nHierarchy group\\nQueue\\nFlow\\nHours of operation\\nPhone number\\nTask templates\\nCustomer profile domain\\nCustomer profile object type\\nOutbound campaigns\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.\\nFor actions that don\\'t support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.\\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\\nThe Amazon Connect instance resource has the following ARN:\\narn:${Partition}:connect:${Region}:${Account}:instance/${InstanceId}\\nFor more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.\\nFor example, to specify the i-1234567890abcdef0 instance in your statement, use the following ARN:\\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0\"\\nTo specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):\\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*\"\\nSome Amazon Connect actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (*).\\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\\nMany Amazon Connect; API actions involve multiple resources. For example,\\nTo specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.\\n\"Resource\": [\\n      \"resource1\",\\n      \"resource2\"\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect resource types and their ARNs, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect. The same article explains with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource.\\nCondition keys\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.\\nIf you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement\\'s permissions are granted.\\nYou can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.\\nAWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAmazon Connect defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAll Amazon EC2 actions support the aws:RequestedRegion and ec2:Region condition keys. For more information, see Example: Restricting Access to a Specific Region.\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nExamples\\nTo view examples of Amazon Connect identity-based policies, see Amazon Connect identity-based policy examples.\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nYou can attach tags to Amazon Connect resources or pass tags in a request to Amazon Connect. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the connect:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.\\nTo view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on the tags on that resource, see Describe and update Amazon Connect users based on tags.\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAn IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.\\nUsing temporary credentials with Amazon Connect\\nYou can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role.

When the agent accepts the call and either the external device has been answered or the CCP determines it can receive a call, a connection to Amazon Connect is established for call media to the agent. Transferred calls When a call is transferred, the transfer event that signals to place an outbound call to the specified transfer destination is sent to Amazon EC2, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call. When the call is connected, the agent is bridged in, anchoring the call to the agent's existing Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.

When the agent logs out or the browser is closed, endpoints are reselected when the agent next logs in. If a connection to Amazon EC2 or Amazon Connect fails, errors display on the CCP. If a connection to CloudFront fails, web elements such as buttons and icons, or even the page itself fails to load correctly.\\nOutbound calls\\nWhen an outbound call is placed, the event signal is sent to the Amazon EC2 endpoint, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call. Upon a successful dial attempt, the agent is bridged in, which anchors the call to the agent's Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also uses the anchor until the call is disconnected. Anchoring can help reduce PSTN latency.\\nInbound calls\\nWhen an inbound call is received, the call is anchored to an Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.\\nWhen an agent is available, the call is pushed through using a new Amazon EC2 connection to their browser and offered to the agent.\\nWhen the agent accepts the call and either the external device has been answered or the CCP determines it can receive a call, a connection to Amazon Connect is established for call media to the agent.\\nTransferred calls\\nWhen a call is transferred, the transfer event that signals to place an outbound call to the specified transfer destination is sent to Amazon EC2, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call.\\nWhen the call is connected, the agent is bridged in, anchoring the call to the agent's existing Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.\\nIf the agent hangs up after the call is bridged, the agent's connection to the call is terminated, but Amazon Connect hangs on to the call at the Amazon Connect anchor point until there is a far side disconnect. When the call is disconnected, contact records and associated recordings are generated and made available for the call.\\nMissed calls\\nIf the call is waiting on an agent, customer queue flow logic is used until an agent is available and the call has been successfully routed to that agent.\\nIf the agent does not accept the call, the agent moves into a Missed Call state and is unable to take calls until the agent, or a call center manager, changes their status to Available again. The caller does not hear ringing while the call is waiting for the agent, and continues to hold until connected with an agent as defined in the customer queue flow logic.\\nPanic logout\\nIf the browser window where the CCP is running is closed, the call remains connected, but opening the browser and logging back in will not allow you to re-establish the media connection. You are still able to transfer or end the call, but no audio path is established between the agent and caller.\\nDid this page help you?\\nYes\\nNo\\nProvide feedback\\nNext topic:Use an allowlist for integrated applications\\nPrevious topic:Using Amazon Connect in a VDI environment\\nNeed help?\\nConnect with an AWS IQ expert \\nPrivacySite termsCookie preferences\\n© 2023, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

This section provides an overview of design principles, best practices, and questions surrounding security for Amazon Connect workloads.\\nAmazon Connect Security Journey\\nAfter you’ve made the decision to move your workload to Amazon Connect, in addition to reviewing Security in Amazon Connect and Security Best Practices for Amazon Connect, follow these guidelines and steps to understand and implement your security requirements relative to the following core security areas:\\nUnderstanding the AWS Security Model\\nWhen you move computer systems and data to the cloud, security responsibilities become shared between you and AWS. AWS is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure that supports the cloud, and you’re responsible for anything you put on the cloud or connect to the cloud.\\nWhich AWS services you use will determine how much configuration work you have to perform as part of your security responsibilities. When you use Amazon Connect, the shared model reflects AWS and customer responsibilities at a high-level, as shown in the following diagram.\\nCompliance Foundations\\nThird-party auditors assess the security and compliance of Amazon Connect as part of multiple AWS compliance programs. These include SOC, PCI, HIPAA, C5 (Frankfurt), and HITRUST CSF.\\nFor a list of AWS services in scope of specific compliance programs, see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program. For general information, see AWS Services Compliance Programs.\\nRegion selection\\nRegion selection to host the Amazon Connect instance depends on data sovereignty restrictions and where the contacts and agents are based. After that decision is made, review network requirements for Amazon Connect and ports and protocols that you need to allow. Additionally, to reduce the blast radius use the domain allow list or allowed IP address ranges for your Amazon Connect instance.\\nFor more information, see Set up your network.\\nAWS services integration\\nWe recommend reviewing each AWS service in your solution against the security requirements of your organization. See the following resources:\\nSecurity in AWS Lambda\\nSecurity and Compliance in DynamoDB\\nSecurity in Amazon Lex\\nData Security in Amazon Connect\\nDuring your security journey, your security teams may require a deeper understanding of how data is handled in Amazon Connect. See the following resources:\\nDetailed network paths for Amazon Connect\\nInfrastructure security in Amazon Connect\\nCompliance validation in Amazon Connect\\nWorkload diagram\\nReview your workload diagram and architect an optimum solution on AWS. This includes analyzing and deciding which additional AWS services should be included in your solution and any third-party and on-premises applications that need to be integrated.\\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\\nTypes of Amazon Connect Personas\\nThere are four types of Amazon Connect personas, based on the activities being performed.\\nAWS administrator – AWS administrators create or modify Amazon Connect resources and may also delegate administrative access to other principals by using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. The scope of this persona is focused on creating and administering your Amazon Connect instance.\\nAmazon Connect administrator – Service administrators determine which Amazon Connect features and resources employees should access within the Amazon Connect console. The service administrator assigns security profiles to determine who can access the Amazon Connect console and what tasks they can perform. The scope of this persona is focused on creating and administering your Amazon Connect contact center.\\nAmazon Connect agent – Agents interact with Amazon Connect to perform their job duties. Service users may be contact center agents or supervisors.\\nAmazon Connect Service contact – The customer who interacts with your Amazon Connect contact center.\\nIAM Administrator Best Practices\\nIAM Administrative access should be limited to approved personnel within your organization. IAM administrators should also understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Connect. For IAM best practices, see Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide. Also see Amazon Connect identity-based policy examples.\\nAmazon Connect Service Administrator Best Practices\\nService administrators are responsible for managing Amazon Connect users, including adding users to Amazon Connect give them their credentials, and assign the appropriate permissions so they can access the features needed to do their job. Administrators should start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary.\\nSecurity profiles help you manage who can access the Amazon Connect dashboard and Contact Control Panel, and who can perform specific tasks. Review the granular permissions granted within the default security profiles available natively. Custom security profiles can be set up to meet specific requirements. For example, a power agent who can take calls but also has access to reports. After this is finalized, users should be assigned to the correct security profiles.\\nMulti-Factor Authentication\\nFor extra security, we recommend that you require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users in your account. MFA can be set up through AWS IAM or your SAML 2.0 identity provider, or Radius server, if that's more applicable for your use case. After MFA is set up, a third text box becomes visible on the Amazon Connect login page to provide the second factor.\\nIdentity Federation\\nIn addition to storing users in Amazon Connect, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) to Amazon Connect by using identity federation. Federation is a recommended practice to allow for employee lifecycle events to be reflected in Amazon Connect when they are made in the source identity provider.\\nAccess to Integrated Applications\\nSteps within your flows may need credentials to access information in external applications and systems. To provide credentials to access other AWS services in a secure way, use IAM roles. An IAM role is an entity that has its own set of permissions, but that isn't a user or group. Roles also don't have their own permanent set of credentials and are automatically rotated.\\nCredentials such as API keys should be stored outside of your flow application code, where they can be retrieved programmatically. To accomplish this, you can use AWS Secrets Manager or an existing third-party solution. Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically.\\nDetective controls\\nLogging and monitoring are important for the availability, reliability and, performance of contact center. You should log relevant information from Amazon Connect Flows to Amazon CloudWatch and build alerts and notifications based on the same.\\nYou should define log retention requirements and lifecycle policies early on, and plan to move log files to cost-efficient storage locations as soon as practical. Amazon Connect public APIs log to AWS CloudTrail. You should review and automate actions set up based on CloudTrail logs.\\nAmazon S3 is the best choice for long-term retention and archiving of log data, especially for organizations with compliance programs that require log data to be auditable in its native format. After log data is in an S3 bucket, define lifecycle rules to automatically enforce retention policies and move these objects to other, cost-effective storage classes, such as Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (Standard - IA) or Amazon S3 Glacier.\\nThe AWS cloud provides flexible infrastructure and tools to support both sophisticated in cooperation with offerings and self-managed centralized-logging solutions. This includes solutions such as Amazon OpenSearch Service and Amazon CloudWatch Logs.\\nFraud detection and prevention for incoming contacts can be implemented by customizing Amazon Connect Flows per the customer requirements. As an example, customers can check incoming contacts against previous contact activity in DynamoDB, and then take action, such as disconnecting a contact because they are a blocked contact.\\nInfrastructure protection\\nAlthough there is no infrastructure to manage in Amazon Connect, there could be scenarios where your Amazon Connect instance needs to interact with other components or applications deployed in infrastructure residing on-premises. Consequently, it is important to ensure that networking boundaries are considered under this assumption. Review and implement specific Amazon Connect infrastructure security considerations. Also, review contact center agent and supervisor desktops or VDI solutions for security considerations.\\nYou can configure a Lambda function to connect to private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your account. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Amazon Connect your function to the VPC to access private resources during execution.\\nData protection\\nCustomers should analyze the data traversing through and interacting with the contact center solution.\\nThird party and external data\\nOn-premises data in hybrid Amazon Connect architectures\\nAfter analyzing the scope of the data, data classifications should be performed paying attention to identifying sensitive data. Amazon Connect conforms to the AWS shared responsibility model. Data protection in Amazon Connect includes best practices like using MFA and TLS and the use of other AWS services, including Amazon Macie.\\nAmazon Connect handles variety of data related to contact centers. This includes phone call media, call recordings, chat transcripts, contact metadata as well as flows, routing profiles and queues. Amazon Connect handles data at rest by segregating data by account ID and instance ID. All data exchanged with Amazon Connect is protected in transit between the user's web browser and Amazon Connect using open standard TLS encryption.\\nYou can specify AWS KMS keys to be used for encryption including bring your own key (BYOK). Additionally, you can use key management options within Amazon S3.\\nProtecting Data Using Client-Side Encryption\\nYour use case may require encryption of sensitive data that is collected by flows. For example, to gather appropriate personal information to customize the customer experience when they interact with your IVR. To do this you can use public-key cryptography with the AWS Encryption SDK. The AWS Encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library designed to make it efficient for everyone to encrypt and decrypt data using open standards and best practices.\\nInput validation\\nPerform input validation to ensure that only properly formed data is entering the flow. This should happen as early as possible in the flow. For example, when prompting a customer to say or enter a telephone number, they may or may not include the country code.\\nAmazon Connect security vectors\\nAmazon Connect security can be divided into three logical layers as illustrated in the following diagram:\\nAgent workstation. The agent workstation layer is not managed by AWS and consists of any physical equipment and third-party technologies, services, and endpoints that facilitate your agent’s voice, data, and access the Amazon Connect interface layer.\\nFollow your security best practices for this layer with special attention to the following:\\nPlan identity management keeping in mind best practices noted in Security Best Practices for Amazon Connect.\\nMitigate insider threat and compliance risk associated with workloads that handle sensitive information, by creating a secure IVR solution that enables you to bypass agent access to sensitive information. By encrypting contact input in your flows, you’re able to capture information securely without exposing it to your agents, their workstations, or their operating environments. For more information, see Encrypt customer input.\\nYou are responsible for maintaining the allowlist of AWS IP addresses, ports, and protocols needed to use Amazon Connect.\\nAWS: The AWS layer includes Amazon Connect and AWS integrations including AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, and other services. Follow the security pillar guidelines for AWS services, with special attention to the following:\\nPlan identity management, keeping in mind best practices noted in Security Best Practices for Amazon Connect.\\nIntegrations with other AWS services: Identify each AWS service in the use case as well as any third-party integration points applicable for this use case.\\nAmazon Connect can integrate with AWS Lambda functions that run inside of a customer VPC through the VPC endpoints for Lambda.\\nExternal: The External layer includes contact points including chat, click-to-call endpoints, and the PSTN for voice calls, integrations you may have with legacy contact center solutions in a Hybrid contact center architecture, and integrations you may have with other third-party solutions. Any entry point or exit point for a third party in your workload is considered the external layer.\\nThis layer also covers integrations customers may have with other third-party solutions and applications such as CRM systems, work force management (WFM), and reporting and visualization tools and applications, such as Tableau and Kibana. You should consider the following areas when securing the external layer:\\nYou can create contact filters for repeat and fraudulent contacts using AWS Lambda to write contact details to DynamoDB from within your flow, including ANI, IP address for click-to-dial and chat endpoints, and any other identifying information to track how many contact requests occur during a given period of time. This approach allows you to query and add contacts to deny lists, automatically disconnecting them if they exceed reasonable levels.\\nANI Fraud detection solutions using Amazon Connect telephony metadata and partner solutions can be used to protect against caller ID spoofing.\\nAmazon Connect Voice ID and other voice biometric partner solutions can be used to enhance and streamline the authentication process. Active voice biometric authentication allows contacts the option to speak specific phrases and use those for voice signature authentication. Passive voice biometrics allow contacts to register their unique voiceprint and use their voiceprint to authenticate with any voice input that meets sufficient length requirements for authentication.\\nMaintain the application integration section in the Amazon Connect console for adding any third-party application or integration points to your allowlist, and remove unused endpoints.\\nSend only the data necessary to meet minimum requirements to external systems that handle sensitive data. For example, if you have only one business unit using your call recording analytics solution, you can set an AWS Lambda trigger in your S3 bucket to process contact records, check for the business unit’s specific queues in the contact record data, and if it is a queue that belongs to the unit, send only that call recording to the external solution. With this approach, you only send the data necessary and avoid the cost and overhead associated with processing unnecessary recordings.\\nFor an integration that enables Amazon Connect to communicate with Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Redshift to enable the streaming of contact records, see Amazon Connect integration: Data streaming.\\nResources\\nDocumentation\\nAWS Cloud Security\\nSecurity in Amazon Connect\\nIAM Best Practices\\nAWS Compliance\\nAWS Security blog\\nArticles\\nSecurity Pillar\\nIntroduction to AWS Security\\nAWS Security Best Practices\\nVideos\\nAWS Security State of the Union\\nAWS Compliance - The Shared Responsibility Model\\nDid this page help you?\\nYes\\nNo\\nProvide feedback\\nNext topic:Reliability\\nPrevious topic:Operational Excellence\\nNeed help?\\nConnect with an AWS IQ expert \\nPrivacySite termsCookie preferences\\n© 2023, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

Also, if you were using the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service before June 8, 2023, when it began supporting service-linked roles, then Amazon Connect Customer Profiles created the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed role in your account. To learn more, see A new role appeared in my IAM account.\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create your first Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain, Customer Profiles creates the service-linked role for you again.\\nEditing a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nDeleting a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nYou don't need to manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed role. When you delete the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Customer Profiles cleans up the resources and deletes the service-linked role for you.\\nYou can also use the AWS CLI or the AWS API to manually delete the service-linked role. To do this, you must first manually clean up the resources for your service-linked role and then you can manually delete it.\\nNote\\nIf the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.\\nTo delete Amazon Connect Customer Profiles resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role\\nDelete the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.\\nTo manually delete the service-linked role using IAM\\nUse the AWS CLI or the AWS API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role.

Amazon Connect supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.\\nActions\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don\\'t have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.\\nInclude actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.\\nPolicy actions in Amazon Connect use the following prefix before the action: connect:. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Connect defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.\\nTo specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:\\n\"Action\": [\\n      \"connect:action1\",\\n      \"connect:action2\"\\nYou can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:\\n\"Action\": \"connect:Describe*\"\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect actions, Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nResources\\nAmazon Connect supports resource-level permissions (specifying a resource ARN in an IAM policy). Following is a list of Amazon Connect resources:\\nInstance\\nContact\\nUser\\nRouting profile\\nSecurity profile\\nHierarchy group\\nQueue\\nFlow\\nHours of operation\\nPhone number\\nTask templates\\nCustomer profile domain\\nCustomer profile object type\\nOutbound campaigns\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.\\nFor actions that don\\'t support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.\\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\\nThe Amazon Connect instance resource has the following ARN:\\narn:${Partition}:connect:${Region}:${Account}:instance/${InstanceId}\\nFor more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.\\nFor example, to specify the i-1234567890abcdef0 instance in your statement, use the following ARN:\\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0\"\\nTo specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):\\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*\"\\nSome Amazon Connect actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (*).\\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\\nMany Amazon Connect; API actions involve multiple resources. For example,\\nTo specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.\\n\"Resource\": [\\n      \"resource1\",\\n      \"resource2\"\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect resource types and their ARNs, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect. The same article explains with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource.\\nCondition keys\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.\\nIf you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement\\'s permissions are granted.\\nYou can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.\\nAWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAmazon Connect defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAll Amazon EC2 actions support the aws:RequestedRegion and ec2:Region condition keys. For more information, see Example: Restricting Access to a Specific Region.\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nExamples\\nTo view examples of Amazon Connect identity-based policies, see Amazon Connect identity-based policy examples.\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nYou can attach tags to Amazon Connect resources or pass tags in a request to Amazon Connect. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the connect:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.\\nTo view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on the tags on that resource, see Describe and update Amazon Connect users based on tags.\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAn IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.\\nUsing temporary credentials with Amazon Connect\\nYou can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken.\\nAmazon Connect supports using temporary credentials.\\nService-linked roles\\nService-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.\\nAmazon Connect supports service-linked roles. For details about creating or managing Amazon Connect service-linked roles, see Use service-linked roles for Amazon Connect.\\nChoosing an IAM role in Amazon Connect\\nWhen you create a resource in Amazon Connect, you must choose a role to allow Amazon Connect to access Amazon EC2 on your behalf. If you have previously created a service role or service-linked role, then Amazon Connect provides you with a list of roles to choose from. It\\'s important to choose a role that allows access to start and stop Amazon EC2 instances.\\nDid this page help you?\\nYes\\nNo\\nProvide feedback\\nNext topic:Identity-based policy examples\\nPrevious topic:Restrict AWS resources that can be associated with Amazon Connect\\nNeed help?\\nConnect with an AWS IQ expert \\nPrivacySite termsCookie preferences\\n© 2023, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

When the agent logs out or the browser is closed, endpoints are reselected when the agent next logs in. If a connection to Amazon EC2 or Amazon Connect fails, errors display on the CCP. If a connection to CloudFront fails, web elements such as buttons and icons, or even the page itself fails to load correctly.\\nOutbound calls\\nWhen an outbound call is placed, the event signal is sent to the Amazon EC2 endpoint, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call. Upon a successful dial attempt, the agent is bridged in, which anchors the call to the agent's Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also uses the anchor until the call is disconnected.

The caller does not hear ringing while the call is waiting for the agent, and continues to hold until connected with an agent as defined in the customer queue flow logic.\\nPanic logout\\nIf the browser window where the CCP is running is closed, the call remains connected, but opening the browser and logging back in will not allow you to re-establish the media connection.

You can then display data in that object (for example, customer address and email) to your agents using the Amazon Connect agent application.\\nThe object type mapping provides Customer Profiles with the following information:\\nHow data should be populated from the object and ingested into the standard profile object.\\nWhat fields should be indexed in the object and how those fields should then be used to assign objects of this type to a specific profile.\\nThere are two ways you can create an object type mapping:\\nUse the Amazon Connect console. The user interface makes data mapping features readily accessible. For example, you can add custom attributes, and define search and unique identifiers for contact models. No coding required!\\nUse the Customer Profiles API. For more information, see the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API Reference.\\nThis topic explains how to create a mapping using the Amazon Connect console.\\nCreate a data mapping using the Amazon Connect console\\nAmazon Connect provides a no-code experience for mapping customer data from homegrown and third-party applications with Amazon S3, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and Marketo.\\nTo create a data mapping, you define an object type mapping that describes what the custom profile object looks like. This mapping defines how fields from your data can be used to either populate fields in the standard profile or how they can be used to assign the data to a specific profile.\\nStep 1: Set up data mapping\\nOpen the Amazon Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/.\\nOn the instances page, choose the instance alias. The instance alias is also your instance name, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL. The following image shows the Amazon Connect virtual contact center instances page, with a box a box around the instance alias.\\nIn the navigation pane, choose Customer profiles, Data mappings.\\nChoose Create data mapping to get started.\\nAt the Set up data mapping page, in the Description section, add a name that will help you identify the source or purpose of this mapping. This is the meta-data of the object type.\\nIn the Data source section:\\nChoose where the data is coming from, such as Salesforce or Zendesk. Based on your selection, Amazon Connect automatically selects the available destinations based on the predefined template.\\nChoose the source object. This is used for you to build your unified profile.\\nIn the Mapping destination section, choose the data that you want to use to build your unified customer profile. This information can be surfaced to your flows and agents to personalize the interactions with contacts.\\nFor more information about supported mapping destinations, see About mapping destinations.\\nIn the Additional options section, you can choose when to opt out of creating new profiles, and how long to retain them. These options help you manage costs.\\nNote\\nBy default the domain retention period is 366 days. To change the retention period set on your domain, use the UpdateDomain API.\\nIf you chose a source other than S3, in the Establish a connection with application section, choose an existing Amazon AppFlow or Amazon EventBridge connection to connect your data, or create a new connection. You can create a new connection by entering details about your account for this data source.\\nAfter the connection is established, you will choose the objects that you want to ingest from your data source.\\nChoose Next.\\nStep 2: Map attributes\\nOn the Map type attributes page, you'll see the field mappings table filled with the predefined template, based on the mapping destination. For example, it's filled with customer, product, case, or order attributes. You can change the predefined template by choosing an attribute (such as AccountNumber) and then selecting a different destination, or enter one of your own custom attributes.\\nThe following image shows an example of the page filled with customer attributes from the template.\\nYou can remove what you don’t want populated in the customer profile, change the source, and add custom attributes.\\nThis mapping uses your data source to populate customer contact information, such as a phone number in the customer profile. It uses attributes from the standard profile template.\\nTip\\nIf you choose to add custom attributes, the destination will always have the prefix Attributes. added to it. This enables Amazon Connect to recognize that it is a custom attribute.\\nAgents can now view custom attributes in the Connect Agent Application under the Additional Information tab sorted in alphabetical order. You can create the name of your choice for each attribute that will be displayed to agents by using the following format: /^Attributes\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:[ _\\\\-]+[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$/\\nAll ingested custom attributes will be displayed in the Connect Agent Application. If you do not wish to show certain information to your agents, do not ingest custom attributes at this time.\\nStep 3: Specify identifiers\\nOn the Specify identifiers page, complete the following sections. Depending on what data you're mapping, it's possible not all of these will appear on your page.\\nNote\\nThe names _profileId, _orderId, _caseId, and _assetId are reserved for internal use. If you decide to use these names as one of your identifier names, they must be declared as LOOKUP_ONLY, which means our system will not save them to match with profiles, standard assets, standard orders, standard cases, or save them for searching your profile, asset, case, or order. If you would like these keys to be usable for searching and matching, you must rename your key. For more information on the LOOKUP_ONLY standard identifier, see Standard identifiers.\\nUnique identifier: You must have a unique identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested.

As you enable additional features in Amazon Connect, additional permissions are added for the service-linked role to access the resources associated with those features:\\nAction: all Amazon Connect actions, connect:*, on all Amazon Connect resources.\\nAction: Amazon S3 s3:GetObject, s3:GetObjectAcl, s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, s3:DeleteObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, and GetBucketAcl for the S3 bucket specified for recorded conversations.\\nIt also grants s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, and s3:GetObjectAcl to the bucket specified for exported reports.\\nAction: Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nprofile:SearchProfiles\\nprofile:CreateProfile\\nprofile:UpdateProfile\\nprofile:AddProfileKey\\nprofile:ListProfileObjects\\nprofile:ListAccountIntegrations\\nprofile:ListProfileObjectTypeTemplates\\nprofile:GetProfileObjectTypeTemplate\\nprofile:ListProfileObjectTypes\\nprofile:GetProfileObjectType\\nto use your default Customer Profiles domain (including profiles and all object-types in domain) with the Amazon Connect flows and agent experience applications.\\nAction: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose firehose:DescribeDeliveryStream and firehose:PutRecord, and firehose:PutRecordBatch for the delivery stream defined for agent event streams and contact records.\\nAction: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams kinesis:PutRecord, kinesis:PutRecords, and kinesis:DescribeStream for the stream specified for agent event streams and contact records.\\nAction: Amazon Lex lex:PostContent for the bots added to your instance.\\nAction: Amazon Lex lex:ListBots, lex:ListBotAliases for all bots created in the account across all Regions.\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Logs logs:CreateLogStream, logs:DescribeLogStreams, and logs:PutLogEvents to the CloudWatch Logs group specified for flow logging.\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics cloudwatch:PutMetricData to publish Amazon Connect usage metrics for an instance to your account.\\nAction: Amazon Connect Voice-ID voiceid:* for the Voice ID domains associated with your instance.\\nAction: EventBridge events:PutRule and events:PutTargets for the Amazon Connect managed EventBridge rule for publishing CTR records for your associated Voice ID domains.\\nAction: outbound campaigns\\nconnect-campaigns:CreateCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:DeleteCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:DescribeCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateCampaignName\\nconnect-campaigns:GetCampaignState\\nconnect-campaigns:GetCampaignStateBatch\\nconnect-campaigns:ListCampaigns\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateOutboundCallConfig\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateDialerConfig\\nconnect-campaigns:PauseCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:ResumeCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:StopCampaign for all operations related to outbound campaigns.\\nYou must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.\\nCreate a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nYou don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you.\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you again.\\nYou can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the Amazon Connect - Full access use case. In the IAM CLI or the IAM API, create a service-linked role with the connect.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.\\nFor instances created before October 2018\\nIf your Amazon Connect instance was created before October 2018, you don't have service-linked roles set up. To create a service-linked role, on the Account overview page, choose Create service-linked role, as shown in the following image.\\nFor a list of the IAM permissions required to create the service-linked role, see Overview page in the Required permissions for using custom IAM policies to manage access to the Amazon Connect console topic.\\nEdit a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nAmazon Connect does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nChecking a service-linked role has permissions for Amazon Lex\\nOn the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles.\\nChoose the name of the role to modify.\\nDelete a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nYou don't need to manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed role. When you delete your Amazon Connect instance in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect cleans up the resources and deletes the service-linked role for you.\\nSupported Regions for Amazon Connect service-linked roles\\nAmazon Connect supports using service-linked roles in all of the regions where the service is available. For more information, see AWS Regions and Endpoints.\"},\n",

       "  'Content': \"Standard identifiers\\n\\nStandard identifiers allow you to set attributes on the key. Decide which identifiers to use based on how you want the data to be ingested in the profiles. For example, you mark phone number with the identifier PROFILE. This means phone number is to be treated as unique identifier. If Customer Profiles gets two contacts with the same phone number, the contacts are going to be merged into a single profile.\\nIdentifier name Description\\nUNIQUE\\nThis identifier must be specified by exactly one index for each object type. This key is used to uniquely identify objects of the object type for either fetching them or if needed update a submitted object at a later date.\\nAll the fields that make up the UNIQUE keys are required to be specified when submitting a new object or it is rejected.\\nPROFILE\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a profile. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any profile that has this key associated with it.\\nIf a profile is found, then the object is assigned to that profile.\\nIf more than one profile is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a profile should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nLOOKUP_ONLY\\nThis identifier indicates the key is not stored after ingesting the object. The key is only to be used for determining the profile during ingestion.\\nThe key value is not associated with the profile during ingestion, which means it can't be used to allow searching for it or matching later ingested objects to the same key.\\nNEW_ONLY\\nIf the profile does not already exist before the object is ingested, the key is associated with the profile. Otherwise the key is only used for matching objects to profiles.\\nSECONDARY\\nDuring the matching of an object to a profile, Customer Profiles first looks up all PROFILE keys that do not have the SECONDARY identifier. These are considered first. SECONDARY keys are only considered if no matching profile is found using these keys.\\nASSET\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an asset. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any asset that has this key associated with it.\\nIf an asset is found, then the object is assigned to that asset.\\nIf more than one asset is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an asset should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nORDER\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an order. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any order that has this key associated with it.\\nIf an order is found, then the object is assigned to that order.\\nIf more than one order is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an order should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nCASE\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a case. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any case that has this key associated with it.\\nIf a case is found, then the object is assigned to that case.\\nIf more than one case is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a case should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\"},\n",

       "  'Content': \"How Amazon Connect works with IAM\\n\\nBefore you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Connect, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Connect. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Connect and other AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.\\nTopics\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nWith IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Connect supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.\\nActions\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.\\nInclude actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.\\nPolicy actions in Amazon Connect use the following prefix before the action: connect:. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Connect defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.\\nTo specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:\\n'Action': [\\n      'connect:action1',\\n      'connect:action2'\\nYou can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:\\n'Action': 'connect:Describe*'\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect actions, Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nResources\\nAmazon Connect supports resource-level permissions (specifying a resource ARN in an IAM policy). Following is a list of Amazon Connect resources:\\nInstance\\nContact\\nUser\\nRouting profile\\nSecurity profile\\nHierarchy group\\nQueue\\nFlow\\nHours of operation\\nPhone number\\nTask templates\\nCustomer profile domain\\nCustomer profile object type\\nOutbound campaigns\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.\\nFor actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.\\n'Resource': '*'\\nThe Amazon Connect instance resource has the following ARN:\\narn:$Partition:connect:$Region:$Account:instance/$InstanceId\\nFor more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.\\nFor example, to specify the i-1234567890abcdef0 instance in your statement, use the following ARN:\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0'\\nTo specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*'\\nSome Amazon Connect actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (*).\\n'Resource': '*'\\nMany Amazon Connect; API actions involve multiple resources. For example,\\nTo specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.\\n'Resource': [\\n      'resource1',\\n      'resource2'\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect resource types and their ARNs, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect. The same article explains with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource.\\nCondition keys\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.\\nIf you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.\\nYou can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.\\nAWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAmazon Connect defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAll Amazon EC2 actions support the aws:RequestedRegion and ec2:Region condition keys. For more information, see Example: Restricting Access to a Specific Region.\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nExamples\\nTo view examples of Amazon Connect identity-based policies, see Amazon Connect identity-based policy examples.\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nYou can attach tags to Amazon Connect resources or pass tags in a request to Amazon Connect. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the connect:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.\\nTo view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on the tags on that resource, see Describe and update Amazon Connect users based on tags.\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAn IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.\\nUsing temporary credentials with Amazon Connect\\nYou can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken.\\nAmazon Connect supports using temporary credentials.\\nService-linked roles\\nService-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.\\nAmazon Connect supports service-linked roles. For details about creating or managing Amazon Connect service-linked roles, see Use service-linked roles for Amazon Connect.\\nChoosing an IAM role in Amazon Connect\\nWhen you create a resource in Amazon Connect, you must choose a role to allow Amazon Connect to access Amazon EC2 on your behalf. If you have previously created a service role or service-linked role, then Amazon Connect provides you with a list of roles to choose from. It's important to choose a role that allows access to start and stop Amazon EC2 instances.\"},\n",

       "  'Content': \"CCP connectivity\\n\\nWhen an agent logs in, the CCP attempts to connect to the Amazon EC2 signaling endpoints listed in the AWS ipranges.json file, Amazon Connect for media, and CloudFront for web artifacts such as images. When the agent logs out or the browser is closed, endpoints are reselected when the agent next logs in. If a connection to Amazon EC2 or Amazon Connect fails, errors display on the CCP. If a connection to CloudFront fails, web elements such as buttons and icons, or even the page itself fails to load correctly.\\nOutbound calls\\nWhen an outbound call is placed, the event signal is sent to the Amazon EC2 endpoint, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call. Upon a successful dial attempt, the agent is bridged in, which anchors the call to the agent's Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also uses the anchor until the call is disconnected. Anchoring can help reduce PSTN latency.\\nInbound calls\\nWhen an inbound call is received, the call is anchored to an Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.\\nWhen an agent is available, the call is pushed through using a new Amazon EC2 connection to their browser and offered to the agent.\\nWhen the agent accepts the call and either the external device has been answered or the CCP determines it can receive a call, a connection to Amazon Connect is established for call media to the agent.\\nTransferred calls\\nWhen a call is transferred, the transfer event that signals to place an outbound call to the specified transfer destination is sent to Amazon EC2, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call.\\nWhen the call is connected, the agent is bridged in, anchoring the call to the agent's existing Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.\\nIf the agent hangs up after the call is bridged, the agent's connection to the call is terminated, but Amazon Connect hangs on to the call at the Amazon Connect anchor point until there is a far side disconnect. When the call is disconnected, contact records and associated recordings are generated and made available for the call.\\nMissed calls\\nIf the call is waiting on an agent, customer queue flow logic is used until an agent is available and the call has been successfully routed to that agent.\\nIf the agent does not accept the call, the agent moves into a Missed Call state and is unable to take calls until the agent, or a call center manager, changes their status to Available again. The caller does not hear ringing while the call is waiting for the agent, and continues to hold until connected with an agent as defined in the customer queue flow logic.\\nPanic logout\\nIf the browser window where the CCP is running is closed, the call remains connected, but opening the browser and logging back in will not allow you to re-establish the media connection. You are still able to transfer or end the call, but no audio path is established between the agent and caller.\"},\n",

       "  'Content': \"Using service-linked roles for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\n\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Customer Profiles. Service-linked roles are predefined by Customer Profiles and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.\\nA service-linked role makes setting up Amazon Connect Customer Profiles easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. Amazon Connect Customer Profiles defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon Connect Customer Profiles can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.\\nFor information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-linked roles column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.\\nService-linked role permissions for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForProfile_unique-id which allows Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to access AWS services and resources on your behalf..\\nThe AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:\\nprofile.amazonaws.com\\nThe role permissions policy named CustomerProfilesServiceLinkedRolePolicy allows Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to complete the following actions on the specified resources:\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics cloudwatch:PutMetricData to publish Amazon Connect usage metrics for an instance to your account.\\nAction: IAM iam:DeleteRole to delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role itself when associated Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain is deleted.\\nYou must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.\\nCreating a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nYou don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create your first Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Customer Profiles creates the service-linked role for you. Note each Amazon Connect Customer Profiles domain requires a dedicated SLR in order for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to take actions for you.\\nImportant\\nThis service-linked role can appear in your account if you completed an action in another service that uses the features supported by this role. Also, if you were using the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service before June 8, 2023, when it began supporting service-linked roles, then Amazon Connect Customer Profiles created the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed role in your account. To learn more, see A new role appeared in my IAM account.\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create your first Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain, Customer Profiles creates the service-linked role for you again.\\nEditing a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nDeleting a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nYou don't need to manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed role. When you delete the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Customer Profiles cleans up the resources and deletes the service-linked role for you.\\nYou can also use the AWS CLI or the AWS API to manually delete the service-linked role. To do this, you must first manually clean up the resources for your service-linked role and then you can manually delete it.\\nNote\\nIf the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.\\nTo delete Amazon Connect Customer Profiles resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role\\nDelete the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.\\nTo manually delete the service-linked role using IAM\\nUse the AWS CLI or the AWS API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nSupported regions for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service-linked roles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles supports using service-linked roles in all of the regions where the service is available.

       "  'Content': \"Create an object type mapping\\n\\nAn object type mapping tells Customer Profiles how to ingest a specific type of data from a source application—such as Salesforce, Zendesk, or S3—into a unified standard profile object. You can then display data in that object (for example, customer address and email) to your agents using the Amazon Connect agent application.\\nThe object type mapping provides Customer Profiles with the following information:\\nHow data should be populated from the object and ingested into the standard profile object.\\nWhat fields should be indexed in the object and how those fields should then be used to assign objects of this type to a specific profile.\\nThere are two ways you can create an object type mapping:\\nUse the Amazon Connect console. The user interface makes data mapping features readily accessible. For example, you can add custom attributes, and define search and unique identifiers for contact models. No coding required!\\nUse the Customer Profiles API. For more information, see the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API Reference.\\nThis topic explains how to create a mapping using the Amazon Connect console.\\nCreate a data mapping using the Amazon Connect console\\nAmazon Connect provides a no-code experience for mapping customer data from homegrown and third-party applications with Amazon S3, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and Marketo.\\nTo create a data mapping, you define an object type mapping that describes what the custom profile object looks like. This mapping defines how fields from your data can be used to either populate fields in the standard profile or how they can be used to assign the data to a specific profile.\\nStep 1: Set up data mapping\\nOpen the Amazon Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/.\\nOn the instances page, choose the instance alias. The instance alias is also your instance name, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL. The following image shows the Amazon Connect virtual contact center instances page, with a box a box around the instance alias.\\nIn the navigation pane, choose Customer profiles, Data mappings.\\nChoose Create data mapping to get started.\\nAt the Set up data mapping page, in the Description section, add a name that will help you identify the source or purpose of this mapping. This is the meta-data of the object type.\\nIn the Data source section:\\nChoose where the data is coming from, such as Salesforce or Zendesk. Based on your selection, Amazon Connect automatically selects the available destinations based on the predefined template.\\nChoose the source object. This is used for you to build your unified profile.\\nIn the Mapping destination section, choose the data that you want to use to build your unified customer profile. This information can be surfaced to your flows and agents to personalize the interactions with contacts.\\nFor more information about supported mapping destinations, see About mapping destinations.\\nIn the Additional options section, you can choose when to opt out of creating new profiles, and how long to retain them. These options help you manage costs.\\nNote\\nBy default the domain retention period is 366 days. To change the retention period set on your domain, use the UpdateDomain API.\\nIf you chose a source other than S3, in the Establish a connection with application section, choose an existing Amazon AppFlow or Amazon EventBridge connection to connect your data, or create a new connection. You can create a new connection by entering details about your account for this data source.\\nAfter the connection is established, you will choose the objects that you want to ingest from your data source.\\nChoose Next.\\nStep 2: Map attributes\\nOn the Map type attributes page, you'll see the field mappings table filled with the predefined template, based on the mapping destination. For example, it's filled with customer, product, case, or order attributes. You can change the predefined template by choosing an attribute (such as AccountNumber) and then selecting a different destination, or enter one of your own custom attributes.\\nThe following image shows an example of the page filled with customer attributes from the template.\\nYou can remove what you don’t want populated in the customer profile, change the source, and add custom attributes.\\nThis mapping uses your data source to populate customer contact information, such as a phone number in the customer profile. It uses attributes from the standard profile template.\\nTip\\nIf you choose to add custom attributes, the destination will always have the prefix Attributes. added to it. This enables Amazon Connect to recognize that it is a custom attribute.\\nAgents can now view custom attributes in the Connect Agent Application under the Additional Information tab sorted in alphabetical order. You can create the name of your choice for each attribute that will be displayed to agents by using the following format: /^Attributes\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:[ _\\\\-]+[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$/\\nAll ingested custom attributes will be displayed in the Connect Agent Application. If you do not wish to show certain information to your agents, do not ingest custom attributes at this time.\\nStep 3: Specify identifiers\\nOn the Specify identifiers page, complete the following sections. Depending on what data you're mapping, it's possible not all of these will appear on your page.\\nNote\\nThe names _profileId, _orderId, _caseId, and _assetId are reserved for internal use. If you decide to use these names as one of your identifier names, they must be declared as LOOKUP_ONLY, which means our system will not save them to match with profiles, standard assets, standard orders, standard cases, or save them for searching your profile, asset, case, or order. If you would like these keys to be usable for searching and matching, you must rename your key. For more information on the LOOKUP_ONLY standard identifier, see Standard identifiers.\\nUnique identifier: You must have a unique identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. This identifier is also known as the unique key. Customer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other data source objects, and to index for search and update data.\\nThere can be only one unique identifier.\\nCustomer identifier: You must have at least one customer identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the profile key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to determine if the data case be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple customer identifiers.\\nTip\\nAgents can use any of these customer Identifiers in the Agent Workspace to find the profile that belongs to customer on the interaction.\\nProduct identifier: You must have at least one product identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the asset key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other customer product purchase data. It is also used to determine if the data can be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple product identifiers.\\nCase identifier: You must have at least one case identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the case key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other customer case data. It is also used to determine if the data can be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple case identifiers.\\nOrder identifier: You must have at least one order identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the order key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other customer order data. It is also used to determine if the data can be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple order identifiers.\\nAdditional search attributes - optional: You can choose attributes in your data source object that you want to index to be searchable. By default, all your identifiers are indexed.\\nData object timestamp: The data object timestamp is used to resolve profile conflicts when Identity Resolution is enabled for consolidating similar profiles. When two or more similar profiles have conflicting records, the records from the profile with the most recently updated timestamp will be used.\\nYou can choose an attribute in your object to reference for when your object was last updated.\\nStep 4: Review and create\\nAfter the data mapping is created, you can choose Add data source integration to use this object type.\"}]"

For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.\\nCreate a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nYou don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you.\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you again.\\nYou can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the Amazon Connect - Full access use case. In the IAM CLI or the IAM API, create a service-linked role with the connect.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.\\nFor instances created before October 2018\\nIf your Amazon Connect instance was created before October 2018, you don't have service-linked roles set up.

For more information, see AWS Regions and Endpoints.Article 1:\\n\\nStandard identifiers\\n\\nStandard identifiers allow you to set attributes on the key. Decide which identifiers to use based on how you want the data to be ingested in the profiles. For example, you mark phone number with the identifier PROFILE. This means phone number is to be treated as unique identifier. If Customer Profiles gets two contacts with the same phone number, the contacts are going to be merged into a single profile.\\nIdentifier name Description\\nUNIQUE\\nThis identifier must be specified by exactly one index for each object type. This key is used to uniquely identify objects of the object type for either fetching them or if needed update a submitted object at a later date.\\nAll the fields that make up the UNIQUE keys are required to be specified when submitting a new object or it is rejected.\\nPROFILE\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a profile. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any profile that has this key associated with it.\\nIf a profile is found, then the object is assigned to that profile.\\nIf more than one profile is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a profile should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nLOOKUP_ONLY\\nThis identifier indicates the key is not stored after ingesting the object. The key is only to be used for determining the profile during ingestion.\\nThe key value is not associated with the profile during ingestion, which means it can't be used to allow searching for it or matching later ingested objects to the same key.\\nNEW_ONLY\\nIf the profile does not already exist before the object is ingested, the key is associated with the profile. Otherwise the key is only used for matching objects to profiles.\\nSECONDARY\\nDuring the matching of an object to a profile, Customer Profiles first looks up all PROFILE keys that do not have the SECONDARY identifier. These are considered first. SECONDARY keys are only considered if no matching profile is found using these keys.\\nASSET\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an asset. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any asset that has this key associated with it.\\nIf an asset is found, then the object is assigned to that asset.\\nIf more than one asset is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an asset should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nORDER\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an order. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any order that has this key associated with it.\\nIf an order is found, then the object is assigned to that order.\\nIf more than one order is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an order should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nCASE\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a case. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any case that has this key associated with it.\\nIf a case is found, then the object is assigned to that case.\\nIf more than one case is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a case should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)Article 2:\\n\\nHow Amazon Connect works with IAM\\n\\nBefore you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Connect, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Connect. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Connect and other AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.\\nTopics\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nWith IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Connect supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.\\nActions\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.\\nInclude actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.\\nPolicy actions in Amazon Connect use the following prefix before the action: connect:. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Connect defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.\\nTo specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:\\n'Action': [\\n      'connect:action1',\\n      'connect:action2'\\nYou can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:\\n'Action': 'connect:Describe*'\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect actions, Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nResources\\nAmazon Connect supports resource-level permissions (specifying a resource ARN in an IAM policy). Following is a list of Amazon Connect resources:\\nInstance\\nContact\\nUser\\nRouting profile\\nSecurity profile\\nHierarchy group\\nQueue\\nFlow\\nHours of operation\\nPhone number\\nTask templates\\nCustomer profile domain\\nCustomer profile object type\\nOutbound campaigns\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.\\nFor actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.\\n'Resource': '*'\\nThe Amazon Connect instance resource has the following ARN:\\narn:$Partition:connect:$Region:$Account:instance/$InstanceId\\nFor more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.\\nFor example, to specify the i-1234567890abcdef0 instance in your statement, use the following ARN:\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0'\\nTo specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*'\\nSome Amazon Connect actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource.

The same article explains with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource.\\nCondition keys\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.\\nIf you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.\\nYou can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.\\nAWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys.

These are considered first. SECONDARY keys are only considered if no matching profile is found using these keys.\\\\nASSET\\\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an asset. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any asset that has this key associated with it.\\\\nIf an asset is found, then the object is assigned to that asset.\\\\nIf more than one asset is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an asset should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\\\nORDER\\\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an order. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any order that has this key associated with it.\\\\nIf an order is found, then the object is assigned to that order.\\\\nIf more than one order is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an order should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\\\nCASE\\\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a case. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any case that has this key associated with it.\\\\nIf a case is found, then the object is assigned to that case.\\\\nIf more than one case is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a case should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)Article 2:\\\\n\\\\nHow Amazon Connect works with IAM\\\\n\\\\nBefore you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Connect, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Connect. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Connect and other AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nTopics\\\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\\\nWith IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Connect supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nActions\\\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\\\nThe Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.\\\\nInclude actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.\\\\nPolicy actions in Amazon Connect use the following prefix before the action: connect:. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Connect defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.\\\\nTo specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:\\\\n'Action': [\\\\n      'connect:action1',\\\\n      'connect:action2'\\\\nYou can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:\\\\n'Action': 'connect:Describe*'\\\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect actions, Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\\\nResources\\\\nAmazon Connect supports resource-level permissions (specifying a resource ARN in an IAM policy). Following is a list of Amazon Connect resources:\\\\nInstance\\\\nContact\\\\nUser\\\\nRouting profile\\\\nSecurity profile\\\\nHierarchy group\\\\nQueue\\\\nFlow\\\\nHours of operation\\\\nPhone number\\\\nTask templates\\\\nCustomer profile domain\\\\nCustomer profile object type\\\\nOutbound campaigns\\\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\\\nThe Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.\\\\nFor actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.\\\\n'Resource': '*'\\\\nThe Amazon Connect instance resource has the following ARN:\\\\narn:$Partition:connect:$Region:$Account:instance/$InstanceId\\\\nFor more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.\\\\nFor example, to specify the i-1234567890abcdef0 instance in your statement, use the following ARN:\\\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0'\\\\nTo specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):\\\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*'\\\\nSome Amazon Connect actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (*).\\\\n'Resource': '*'\\\\nMany Amazon Connect; API actions involve multiple resources. For example,\\\\nTo specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.\\\\n'Resource': [\\\\n      'resource1',\\\\n      'resource2'\\\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect resource types and their ARNs, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect. The same article explains with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource.\\\\nCondition keys\\\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\\\nThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.\\\\nIf you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.\\\\nYou can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nAWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nAmazon Connect defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nAll Amazon EC2 actions support the aws:RequestedRegion and ec2:Region condition keys. For more information, see Example: Restricting Access to a Specific Region.\\\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\\\nExamples\\\\nTo view examples of Amazon Connect identity-based policies, see Amazon Connect identity-based policy examples.\\\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\\\nYou can attach tags to Amazon Connect resources or pass tags in a request to Amazon Connect. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the connect:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.\\\\nTo view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on the tags on that resource, see Describe and update Amazon Connect users based on tags.\\\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\\\nAn IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.\\\\nUsing temporary credentials with Amazon Connect\\\\nYou can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken.\\\\nAmazon Connect supports using temporary credentials.\\\\nService-linked roles\\\\nService-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.\\\\nAmazon Connect supports service-linked roles. For details about creating or managing Amazon Connect service-linked roles, see Use service-linked roles for Amazon Connect.\\\\nChoosing an IAM role in Amazon Connect\\\\nWhen you create a resource in Amazon Connect, you must choose a role to allow Amazon Connect to access Amazon EC2 on your behalf. If you have previously created a service role or service-linked role, then Amazon Connect provides you with a list of roles to choose from. It's important to choose a role that allows access to start and stop Amazon EC2 instances.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the above articles, answer briefly and concisely the following question:\\\\n\\\\nWhat is Amazon Connect?\\\\n\\\\nGet your answer only from the articles, whitout making up new information.

A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an Amazon Connect instance.\\\\nService-linked roles are predefined by Amazon Connect and include all the permissions that Amazon Connect requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.\\\\nYou need to enable service-linked roles so you can use new features in Amazon Connect, such as tagging support, the new user interface in User management and Routing profiles, and queues with CloudTrail support.\\\\nFor information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.\\\\nService-linked role permissions for Amazon Connect\\\\nAmazon Connect uses the service-linked role with the prefix AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect_unique-id \\\\u2013 Grants Amazon Connect permission to access AWS resources on your behalf.\\\\nThe AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:\\\\nconnect.amazonaws.com\\\\nThe role permissions policy allows Amazon Connect to complete the following actions on the specified resources. As you enable additional features in Amazon Connect, additional permissions are added for the service-linked role to access the resources associated with those features:\\\\nAction: all Amazon Connect actions, connect:*, on all Amazon Connect resources.\\\\nAction: Amazon S3 s3:GetObject, s3:GetObjectAcl, s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, s3:DeleteObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, and GetBucketAcl for the S3 bucket specified for recorded conversations.\\\\nIt also grants s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, and s3:GetObjectAcl to the bucket specified for exported reports.\\\\nAction: Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\\\nprofile:SearchProfiles\\\\nprofile:CreateProfile\\\\nprofile:UpdateProfile\\\\nprofile:AddProfileKey\\\\nprofile:ListProfileObjects\\\\nprofile:ListAccountIntegrations\\\\nprofile:ListProfileObjectTypeTemplates\\\\nprofile:GetProfileObjectTypeTemplate\\\\nprofile:ListProfileObjectTypes\\\\nprofile:GetProfileObjectType\\\\nto use your default Customer Profiles domain (including profiles and all object-types in domain) with the Amazon Connect flows and agent experience applications.\\\\nAction: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose firehose:DescribeDeliveryStream and firehose:PutRecord, and firehose:PutRecordBatch for the delivery stream defined for agent event streams and contact records.\\\\nAction: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams kinesis:PutRecord, kinesis:PutRecords, and kinesis:DescribeStream for the stream specified for agent event streams and contact records.\\\\nAction: Amazon Lex lex:PostContent for the bots added to your instance.\\\\nAction: Amazon Lex lex:ListBots, lex:ListBotAliases for all bots created in the account across all Regions.\\\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Logs logs:CreateLogStream, logs:DescribeLogStreams, and logs:PutLogEvents to the CloudWatch Logs group specified for flow logging.\\\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics cloudwatch:PutMetricData to publish Amazon Connect usage metrics for an instance to your account.\\\\nAction: Amazon Connect Voice-ID voiceid:* for the Voice ID domains associated with your instance.\\\\nAction: EventBridge events:PutRule and events:PutTargets for the Amazon Connect managed EventBridge rule for publishing CTR records for your associated Voice ID domains.\\\\nAction: outbound campaigns\\\\nconnect-campaigns:CreateCampaign\\\\nconnect-campaigns:DeleteCampaign\\\\nconnect-campaigns:DescribeCampaign\\\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateCampaignName\\\\nconnect-campaigns:GetCampaignState\\\\nconnect-campaigns:GetCampaignStateBatch\\\\nconnect-campaigns:ListCampaigns\\\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateOutboundCallConfig\\\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateDialerConfig\\\\nconnect-campaigns:PauseCampaign\\\\nconnect-campaigns:ResumeCampaign\\\\nconnect-campaigns:StopCampaign for all operations related to outbound campaigns.\\\\nYou must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nCreate a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\\\nYou don\\'t need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you.\\\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you again.\\\\nYou can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the Amazon Connect - Full access use case. In the IAM CLI or the IAM API, create a service-linked role with the connect.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.\\\\nFor instances created before October 2018\\\\nIf your Amazon Connect instance was created before October 2018, you don\\'t have service-linked roles set up. To create a service-linked role, on the Account overview page, choose Create service-linked role, as shown in the following image.\\\\nFor a list of the IAM permissions required to create the service-linked role, see Overview page in the Required permissions for using custom IAM policies to manage access to the Amazon Connect console topic.\\\\nEdit a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\\\nAmazon Connect does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\\\nChecking a service-linked role has permissions for Amazon Lex\\\\nOn the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles.\\\\nChoose the name of the role to modify.\\\\nDelete a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\\\nYou don\\'t need to manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed role. When you delete your Amazon Connect instance in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect cleans up the resources and deletes the service-linked role for you.\\\\nSupported Regions for Amazon Connect service-linked roles\\\\nAmazon Connect supports using service-linked roles in all of the regions where the service is available. For more information, see AWS Regions and Endpoints.Article 1:\\\\n\\\\nStandard identifiers\\\\n\\\\nStandard identifiers allow you to set attributes on the key. Decide which identifiers to use based on how you want the data to be ingested in the profiles. For example, you mark phone number with the identifier PROFILE. This means phone number is to be treated as unique identifier. If Customer Profiles gets two contacts with the same phone number, the contacts are going to be merged into a single profile.\\\\nIdentifier name Description\\\\nUNIQUE\\\\nThis identifier must be specified by exactly one index for each object type.
